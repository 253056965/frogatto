Hi there - thanks for taking the hassle to report a bug on Frogatto.  Here's a heads-up on a few things that will make life easier for everyone:
- **If you're running Frogatto from our current publicly-available release version, please don't file a bug at all.**  Yes - you heard that right; our old version 1.3 (on the Mac App Store, Ubuntu's repos, etc) is no longer being actively supported.  Most of the serious issues with it are design problems in the code that can only be solved with a deep rewrite - which is exactly what we've been doing in the new release we're working on.  I appreciate any eagerness to help, but filing a bug ends up eating a bit of our time and slows down getting the new release out, so if you do it you're probably wasting your own time as well as ours.  "Thanks, but no thanks," as it were.
- Frogatto's built on top of **[the Anura Engine](https://github.com/anura-engine/anura)**; lots of bugs, especially anything to do with the program failing to launch right, or having major graphical breakdowns, are probably issues with the engine rather than issues with Frogatto itself.  This is pretty hard to judge sometimes, but for example - if the problem happens right when you double click the exe, rather than happening well into the game, it's an Anura issue.  The same applies to any hardware integration, such as gamepad support.  If you have one of these, please [post it on Anura's issue tracker](https://github.com/anura-engine/anura/issues) instead.
