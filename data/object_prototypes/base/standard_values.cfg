# rationale for this file:
#  Multiple basic prototypes use these values, and previously redundantly had them as literal constants.
#  Objects based on prototypes can't refer to the properties in said prototype if they redeclare them - they frequently do to put that value in a conditional, and they have to redeclare it as yet another redundant copy of this constant.

#  certain functions are truly global, but need the convenience of being properties for easy access to the referring object's scope
properties: {

#-------------------------- global values --------------------------#
	standard_thrown_damage: 400,
	kill_anything:  20000,		#a large int meant to be fatal to anything
	
	lower_difficulty: "level.player.difficulty < level.player.difficulty_challenging",
	higher_difficulty: "level.player.difficulty > level.player.difficulty_casual",

	max_recursion_depth: 1000,  #incorrect behavior is better than stack overflows, which we'd occasionally get if FFL is allowed to recurse indefinitely.  This has to manually be checked against a counter value.
