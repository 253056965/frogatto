//This object is automatically spawned by "sound-sources" in-game; it doesn't need to manually be placed by people editing levels, nor does it need to be spawned by object-writers who are using sound-sources to give in-game objects a tracked sound.  This coordinates multiple instances of a single sound so that only one instance of them plays at a given time, passing control to a new one if one of them is going to be removed.
